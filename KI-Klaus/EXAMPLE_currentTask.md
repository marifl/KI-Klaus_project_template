## Planning and Rationale

**Current Role**: Backend Expert

**What I Plan to Do**:

- **Implement User Authentication**:
  - Add login and registration endpoints to the API.
  - Use JWT tokens for session management.
- **Refactor Backend Code**:
  - Split `app.py` into multiple modules (`auth.py`, `database.py`, `routes.py`).
  - Update all references and imports accordingly.

**Why I Plan to Do It**:

- **User Authentication**:
  - Essential for securing the application and managing user access.
  - Aligns with the project's security requirements.
- **Code Refactoring**:
  - `app.py` exceeds the 300-line limit, making it harder to maintain.
  - Modular code improves readability and facilitates collaboration.
